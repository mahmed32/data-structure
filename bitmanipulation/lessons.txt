shift left and shift right problems:


uses of XOR operator in solving problems: what kind of problems does it solve?

THE BIG XOR TRICK!
    "if we have a sequence of XOR operations, then we can remove all pairs of 
     duplicated values without affecting the result."

1-find odd occurance of a number among even occurances.

2-find the missing number in an unsorted array of numbers from 1 to n
    - can be solved by computing n(n+1)/2 "summation formula" but may cause overflow
    - the solution for the overflow problem is to as you iterate the right sequence
      and then subtract the array elment. "solution found in findMissing.py"
    - you can use XOR using the fact a^a = 0 and a^0 = a, by first create two 
      variables the first contains the sequence from 1 to n, i.e. the right
      sequence all XORed, and the second variable contains the array elements
      all XORed using the fact the array is missing a number away from the 
      right sequence. using a^b will give the right missing number.

3-it can be used to implement more efficient doubly linked list by replacing next
  and previos pointer by the XOR of them.

4-find the two non-repeating elements in an array of repeating elements.
  this is an algorithm based on xor operator. using two facts:
    - the first is xor of two different integers will return a set of bits in which
      when ever a bit is in one and not in the other. that is the bits not in both 
      but in each one of the two.
    - the second is using the idea of getting the right most bit of an integer, by
      first subtract one to make the first one bit be zero, and then invert the set
      to make the zero bit be one, noting that not counting if there is leading zeros
  the algorithm is found in "findNonRepeatingTwo.py"

5-Position of rightmost set bit, not here to get the position in a binary number
  you should not divide by two. instead since each positoin has weight of 2 power n
  where n is the postion starting from 0. to get the other way around you should take
  the log base 2 not divide by 2.

6-knowing that 1<<n will give you a number with just the n-th bit from right is set.

7-to set a bit in the n-th position of num use => num | (1<<n)

8-to unset a bit in the n-th postion of num use => num & ~(1<<n)

9-toggling a bit in the n-th position of num use => num ^ (1<<n)

10- 1's complement of a number ~(num)

11- clear the first n bits from right "unset them", first thing we can think of 
    is to have a number that has all first n bits from right = 0 and after them
    all bits are = 1. and then ANDing it with the original number will give the
    desiried output => num = num & ~((1<<n+1) - 1)

12- 1<<n means move the one to the nth index (start from 0).

13- when shifting to the left if there is a leading one it will be thrown away
    and no longer multipling by 2.
14- to get rid of the first set bit x & (x-1).

15- you may use shiftting operators to move bits from one register to another.

16- two's complment two a binary number is equal to one added to its one complment.

17- arithmetic shifts: - shift left add zeros to the begining and descard the MSBs
                       - shift right fill the MSBs with the previous bit in the MSB.
18- logical shifts: - shift left same as arithmetic shifts left.
                    - shift right fill MSBs with zeros.
19- circular shift: it is obvious from its name.
