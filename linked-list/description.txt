Linked list:

what is a linked list:
    - a linked list is a data structure used to store "nodes" of data that are linked together 
        1- these nodes "in general" are not contiguos in memory
        2- each node consists of two parts one for the data itself and the other for the pointerto the next and/or
        previous node
        3- all the nodes share the same type data which means a node that has int can point to only node of int


what are linked lists good in:
    - linked lists are very fast at inserting and deleting elemnts " constant time"

what is the down side:
    - linked lists are not contiguous in memory which make them slow compaired to arrays
    - a linked list allowcate space for pointers which make it space inifficient for large lists
    - if the list's data value is small compaired to the size of a pointer then it is very bad to store these type in a
      linked list
