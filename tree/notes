GENERAL TREES:

WHAT IS A TREE?

- A tree is a collection of nodes connected to each other by a link. A tree is non-linear data structure
  which means I don't care about the order you but the data in the tree. what is I care about is a key
  representing those data not the order of the data stored. We can't go to a node by to paths
  A path is just jumping from one node to another by a link. So no node can have two links points to
  another node. So in general A node is either a parent or child or both. a parent node is a node
  that has a link to another node. A child node is a node that can be reached via a link from its parent node
  the relation between A partent node and a child node is 1 -> N. each child has 1 and only 1 parent
  A node can be both a Child and a parent in the same time , if it has a link to another node and can be refrenced
  by its parent Such a node is called INTERNAL NODE. There is only one node that is parent and not child
  which we call it the ROOT of the tree. There is no node has a pointer to the root. and the root has pointers to
  its children. if A node is only a child node it is called a LEAF NODE.

WHAT IS A TREE'S ROOT?

- Is the only node with no parents

WHAT IS A NODE?

- A node is just a structure that has some sort of data in interest for example may be an integer
  or strings or may be a class defined by you. And also has pointer to another nodes.

WHAT IS A NODE'S PERANT?

- If I'm the node then my parent is the node that contains the link that points to me.

WHAT IS a NODE'S CHILDS?

- Are the nodes that my node's pointers point to. maybe point to null.which means have no children
  that is a leaf node.

WHAT IS A NODE'S HEIGHT?

- In Computer Science Trees are upside down of real trees so the height of a real tree is
  the hight units from the groun up to certain branch. But in computer science the height by the same
  analogy is the largest number of height units that can be reached by following a path from the node
  to a leaf node. the height unit is edge.
- Mathy def: The height of a node is the longest path that can be taken from the node to a leaf node.
  with the height unit as the edge.
- form this the height of a leaf is 0.
- and the height of a null node is -1.

WHAT IS A NODE'S DEPTH?

- In contrast to the height, the depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node in question.
- the depth of the root is 0.
- the max depth is the height of the tree
- the height of the tree is the number of edges from the longest path from the root to a leaf
- the max depth is the depth of the most far away leaf node from the root which is the same as the depth of it
- hence max depth = height of tree.

WHAT IS THE TREE'S HEIGHT?

- is the height of the root.

WHAT IS THE TREE'S MAX DEPTH?

- Is the height of the tree or in other words the height of the root node

WHAT IS A NODE'S LEVEL?

- is its depth + 1

WHAT IS THE TREE MAX LEVEL?

- max depth + 1

HOW TO VISIT A NODE IN A TREE?

- By traversing the nodes we have two methodes fo traversing nodes in the tree:
 1- Breadth first search:
     - In this technique we process all nodes level by level begining from the root going down
       to the level.
       Algorithm:

       Begin by inialize a queue with the root node
       loop unitl the queue becomes empty:
            element <- get the front from the queue
            if element is desired: break
            push to the queue all element's children from left to right if exists
 2- Depth first search:
     - In this techniqe we process the nodes by going along the way to the depth of the tree
       process all the elements that in the way. we have 3 methods
        1- pre-order : self -> left -> right
        2- post-order: left -> right -> self
        3- inorder   : left -> self -> right
        Algorithm:
        trivial with recurerion.

HOW MANY EDGES IN A TREE WITH n NODES?

- n-1 edges, Because each node has an edge points to it execpt the root

WHAT IS THE MAX DEPTH OF A TREE?

- is the height of the root

BINARY TREES:

WHAT IS COMPLETE TREE?

- Is Binary tree with all intermidate levels are filled with nodes. but the last level is partially filled
  and must be filled from left to right.

WHAT IS A PERFECT TREE?

- Is A complete binary tree with all levels are full of nodes

WHAT IS THE MAX NUMBER OF NODES IN A binary TREE WITH HEIGHT h?

- Each level has 2^(level - 1) nodes. the max level is max depth + 1 hence
  the number of nodes will be 2^(0) + 2^(1) + ... + 2^(max depth). the 
  height of a tree is just the max depth.So we get a #nodes = 2^(0) + 2^(1) + ... + 2^(h) =

                                 2^(h+1) - 1

- So if given the number of nodes in a binary tree and asking for the minimum height then 

                             min_h = lg(n+1) - 1 

WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF A BALANCED BINARY TREE?

- the absolute value of the difference between a node's children must be at most k

                         |H(n.left) - H(n.right)| <= k
