Arrays

what they are?
    - an array is a data structure used to store data and has three main properties:
        1- these data that array stores are contiguous in memory.
        2- arrays allow random access to the elments by simple pointer arithmatic, which make indexing done in constant
        time.
        3- the data in the array must share the same type.
        
what are they good in?
    - as explained array are very fast in indexing elemnts so they are good if you want to access some elements by
      index.

IN GENERAL 
            " ARRAYS ARE FAST TO READ "
