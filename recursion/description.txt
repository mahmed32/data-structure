Recursion

A function or algorithm is recursive if it calls itself.
Imagine you are in cenima and one ask you which row you are in?, You don't want to think or count, so you ask the one in
front of you which row you are in? you know the asnwer is less than the row you are in by one,
the one in front of you do as like as you did, and ask the one in front of him which row you are in and so on .. until
the one in the first row answers I'm in row one, then answer return back to the second row and so on until the first one
who asked the quistion.

the following is a function to get the max number in an array:

int largest(int arr[], size)
{
    if(size == 1)
        return arr[size-1];
    return max(arr[size-1], largest(arr[], size-1));
}

the following is a function to return the log of a number n base b
int log(int b, int n)
{
    if(n == 1)
        return 0;
    return log(b, n/b) + 1;
}
