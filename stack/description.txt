Stack

what is a stack?
 - a stack is an abstract data type and a linear data structure whose data elements are connected in sequintial manner.

what kind of operations that supported by the stack?
 - a stack follow special sequence of operations as LIFO (last in first out), to understand it imagine you have some
   plates in your kitchen, these plates are of the same size and shape(same data types), the plates are putted in such a
   way that each plate is above a plate which forms a "stack" of plates, now if you want to pick a plate in the middle
   of the stack you MUST pop all the plates that are above it, you cannot just "slice" it that is the only plate that
   you can use is the top plate. from this example the operations are obvious, top(), push(), pop(), empty().

uses:
    for now stacks are useful for nested structures


examples:
    the stack memory.
